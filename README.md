# get_ftemp

**A Bash command for Raspberry Pi that displays CPU temperature in Fahrenheit instead of Celcius.**

This Bash command retrieves and converts the CPU temperature on a Raspberry Pi from Celsius to Fahrenheit. It provides a convenient way to monitor the temperature of your Raspberry Pi system if you don't customarily use Fahrenheit.

**Note:** Not all Raspberry Pi models may have the capability to read their current CPU temperature. Compatibility will vary with your specific model.

**Tested On:**
- Raspberry Pi Model: B3
- Operating System: Raspbian Bookworm (Debian GNU/Linux Version 12)
